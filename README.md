(Technologies used)
  JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery
  
(Your process/approach)
  The initial planning was all done on paper. I drew out a basic design with notes and such on what I wanted for specifics. Initially, I had a completely different design in mind that I scrapped because it looked dumb. After that I used the sample project as a visual template. 
   I worked all week on it. I spent a lot of time Googling my issues and watching youtube tutorials. 
   
(Unsolved problems)
  I just could not get the lightbox to work. So, that's a bummer. 

(Your biggest wins and challenges)
  Biggest win was that I was able to actually build a page. I got pretty far in the project, so that makes me feel pretty good. 
 Â  Challenges. The whole thing was a major challenge. But, the greatest challenge was the lightbox that I never sloved.
